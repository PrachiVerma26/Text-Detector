# Text-Detector 
To design this system I've used python language with different modules like opencv so that we can open camera, tesseract to detect the text from the image and other modules too.
In this we have two modes :-
1) Image mode - In this, we can detect text from image which is already present in the system.
2) Webcam mode - In this, we can detect text from image by caputuring image using webcam present in the system.
3)
